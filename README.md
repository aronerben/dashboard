# dashboard

Zero config dashboard for generic data rendering. Throw all your data at it!

## Setup

To run the backend with auto-reload enabled run:

	lein run

To auto run the tests run:

	lein test-refresh

To get an interactive development environment in the frontend run:

	lein figwheel


Alternatively you can use something like Cider for emacs:

	M-x cider-jack-in-clojurescript

and open your browser at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

You should have two REPLs now, one for CLJS and one for CLJ.

To clean all compiled files:

	lein clean

To create a production build run:

	lein do clean, cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.

Get refactoring suggestions by using:

`lein kibit`

Run the bikeshed linter by using:

`lein bikeshed`

Run the eastwood linter by using:

`lein eastwood`
